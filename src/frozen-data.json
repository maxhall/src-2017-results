The inclusion of ticket members with markedly more conservative views, such as Georgette Bechara, garnered the support of right-wing students and organisations like the University\u2019s Conservative Club. However, Mint for Honi ended up creating a ticket too diverse for most of its members to tolerate. The ticket disbanded when Bechara appeared to show support for a homophobic statement, and the Conservative Club rallied around her in anger at her dismissal.<p>\n<p>Given Ma is a member of the liberal party pushing for conservative economic reforms within the SRC, the overlap between his supporters and Mint\u2019s makes sense.<p>"
